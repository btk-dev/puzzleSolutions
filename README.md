A collection of my solutions to various programming puzzles

1) Kaggle Titanic Survivors - As an intro to machine learning and data science I attempted the Kaggle Titanic survival rate dataset. After attemping several models K-nearest came closest in my dataset and achieved a 75.598% correct on final solution, showing a possible overfitting of data, as it is lower than the 82% it achieved on sample data.
